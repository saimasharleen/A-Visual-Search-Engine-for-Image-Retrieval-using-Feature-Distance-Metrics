# A-Visual-Search-Engine-for-Image-Retrieval-using-Feature-Distance-Metrics
A query image as input and returning the N most similar images from a gallery. 

This study investigates image classification and retrieval using var-
ious deep learning models, including a CNN built from inception

and transfer learning-based models such as ResNet and VGG. Limi-
tations and opportunities for future advancement in this discipline

are identified by the research. The size of the dataset is a limita-
tion, indicating that a larger dataset is required to enhance model

generalization. Analyzing the evaluation metrics highlights the
importance of integrating additional metrics for a comprehensive
evaluation. Model selection and architecture justification, as well
as the investigation of model interpretability and explainability,
are identified as areas for enhancement. The study recommends

potential improvements to fine-tuning strategies, data augmenta-
tion techniques, and the investigation of alternative architectures.

In conclusion, the abstract highlights the importance of resolving
these limitations and conducting additional research to enhance
the performance and comprehension of image classification and
retrieval systems.
